An app for Zenfullness
Does not it make us anxious if our phone rings while we are in the middle of a lecture or conference etc., So to avoid these situations
we silence our phones but the biggest drawback is that we forget to bring back the phone to normal state, thus inorder to help users to 
solve this dilemma we developed a creative Android App wherein the user enters a time period (From and To Period) and during this peripd the 
mobile is silent and it is automatically brought back to normal state at the end of the time slot.
